# about
I bought a clip circuit set for my kids, but being Dutch and kids being young i was in need of a Dutch translation of the manual.

After trying a few translations options from scans i decided i needed to re-create the images available, and re-create the manual.

This prject contains a html document where you can drag and drop the different clip-circuit components to your canvas and re-create the different setups from the manual, but also create your own custom ones.

# how it works
Open the index.html file in your browser. In the site menu on the right you will find al components. Click a component to add it to the canvas. Clicking a component on the canvas will bring it on top of alll other components.

When you put your mouse on top of a component on the canvas you can:
- delete it from canvas by clicking the X
- rotate it 90 degrees by clicking the rotate button
- move it on the canvas (grid) by holding your mouse down on the drag symbol and more it arround

# to do
For now i took screen-shots and used the images in the Dutch manual available. Final idea is to add an optional menu to save a canvas in local-storage and open it again later.
